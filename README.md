Space-SAM：On-Orbit Real-Time Semantic Segmentation for SpaceImaging Objects.

image_denose_test.zip has been open-sourced, containing the code for the denoising module. It employs deep learning methods to effectively filter out noise in complex space environments.

We will gradually open-source additional data and code for everyone to use and learn from. If you find this helpful, please cite “Space-SAM: On-Orbit Real-Time Semantic Segmentation for Space Imaging Objects” in your work.
