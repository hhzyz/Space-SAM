image_denose_test.zip has been open-sourced, containing the code for the denoising module. It employs deep learning methods to effectively filter out noise in complex space environments.

label2json.zip is the code developed in this paper, now open-sourced, which converts tag data into standardized JSON files for subsequent data processing or integration into other systems.

addnoise.zip contains the noise-adding code developed in this paper, capable of simultaneously introducing Gaussian noise, salt-and-pepper noise, and Poisson noise. Due to space constraints, this paper focuses solely on the effects of Gaussian noise on spatial imaging. Should future researchers wish to investigate the impact of other noise types based on this work, this code may serve as a reference open-source resource.

We will gradually open-source additional data and code for everyone to use and learn from. If you find this helpful, please cite “Space-SAM: On-Orbit Real-Time Semantic Segmentation for Space Imaging Objects” in your work.
